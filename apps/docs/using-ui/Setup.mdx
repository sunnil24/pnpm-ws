# Setup

## 1. IntelliSense

The official [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/editor-setup#intelli-sense-for-vs-code) for Visual Studio Code enhances the Tailwind development experience by providing users with advanced features such as autocomplete, syntax highlighting, and linting.

## 2. Setup TailwindCSS and PostCSS

- Add tailwind (shared package) as the dependency in the app where you want to setup tailwind as follows:

  ```js
  "dependencies": {
    "tailwind": "*",
    // other dependencies...
  }
  ```

  <br />
  <Callout kind='info'>
    A symlink for tailwind package is already created at the root level.
  </Callout>

- Run the install command (yarn install)

- Create a tailwind.config.js file in the app

- Import the linked package:

  ```js
  const tailwindConfig = require("tailwind/config/tailwind.config");

  module.exports = tailwindConfig;
  ```

- Repeat the same process for postcss.

## 3. CSS Setup

- Go to your **\_app.tsx** file or the root file and import the following:

  ```js
  import "tailwind/styles/tailwind.css";
  ```

## 4. Use The components

- Go to the file where you want to use the components that you have created in your ui-lib and import as follows:

```js
import { Button } from "{button}";
```

- Checkout the documentation on [Button](?path=/docs/component-button--docs) to get the appropriate code for your page.

## 5. Add More

Go to libs/ui-lib/src/components and add or compose new components based on the requirements.
