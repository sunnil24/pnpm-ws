## Tailwind Config Installation
Tailwind Configuration Package
Our Tailwind Configuration Package offers a custom configuration for Tailwind CSS. It comes with a set of pre-defined themes, utility classes, and all necessary Tailwind-related packages.
Follow these steps to install the Tailwind Configuration Package:

## 1. Run the following command in your project directory:

  ```js
        yarn add @xyzproject/tailwind-config@latest

  ```
## 2. Create two configuration files in your project:

Tailwind.config.js
Postcss.config.js
In these files, import the respective configurations from the installed package:


- Run the install command (yarn install)

- Create a tailwind.config.js file in the app

- Import the linked package:

```js
{/* In Tailwind.config.js: */}
import { tailwindConfig } from "@xyzproject/tailwind-config ";

export default tailwindConfig

{/* In Postcss.config.js: */}

import { postconfig } from "@xyzproject/tailwind-config ";

export default postConfig

```

## 3. CSS Setup

- Go to your **\_app.tsx** file or the root file and import the following:

  ```js
  import "@xyzproject/tailwind-config /styles/tailwind.css";
  ```

## 4. Use The components

- Go to the file where you want to use the components that you have created in your ui-lib and import as follows:

```js
import { Button } from "{button}";
<Button>Button Component </Button>
```
